# Python Developer (open-source contributor)

Passionate about data? If you want to be part of building the next generation of open source tooling for open data management systems, we’d love to hear from you!
 
A little about us… 
- We’re mission-driven 
- Open-source
- Have a great culture 
- Datopian is run using self-organisation principles and Holacracy
- Love the freedom that remote / flexible working gives us
- We’re inspired to work on interesting projects (key clients include large public institutions, NGOs and enterprises)

We operate virtually, so you will have the freedom to work from wherever you want (meeting scheduling permitting).

## About this role

We are looking for a highly-motivated and skilled individual to join us as a **Python Developer** to work on [CKAN project](https://ckan.org/) which is an open-source Python software currently maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/ckan/ckan). A new joiner will be working on new features towards major release of CKAN version 3.

## Expectations

- Experience: mid to senior level software engineer with strong Python development background.
- Communication and soft skills: needs to be proficient in written and spoken English, confident during presentations and interactions.
- Must know:
  - Git - we use git for everything we do from coding to content writing so you need to use Git via command line and commit your work to GitHub on daily basis.
  - Python - our main software is written in Python (learn more about it [here](https://github.com/ckan/ckan)) and you need to be able to maintain the code, develop extensions and new features etc. In particular, you would need to know Flask framework and Jinja2 templating engine.
  - Docker - as we ship our software in Docker containers, you need to work with Docker on a daily basis.
- Good to have:
  - Kubernetes - we deploy everywhere (GCP, AWS, Azure or on-prem) using Kubernetes.
  - Terraform - our standard tool for infrastructure-as-a-code approach.
  - Cloud - preference is GCP but experience with AWS/Azure is a great value for us.
- Bonus if you know:
  - JavaScript - pure JS is great but we also use a lot of Next.js nowadays.
  - CSS - in particular TailwindCSS and/or Bootstrap would be amazing.

## About the engagement

**Start date:** As soon as feasible.

**Rate:** Commensurate with ability and experience.

**Location:** Datopian is a remote-first workplace; experience in remote working is desirable (but not essential). We are currently looking for people in European  / East Coast US time zone (we’re happy for people to work elsewhere provided they are available for meetings during European / East Coast usual working hours).

## How to apply

Please, go ahead to the current list of issues in CKAN repository where you can find items with "Good for Contribution" label:

https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+for+Contribution%22

Select an issue that you feel confident with and add a comment about your willingness to contribute. Please, ping @anuveyatsu in your comment so that we can understand your intention.

**IMPORTANT:** please, note that some issues might not be straightforward and can take long time to have your PR merged into the main branch. Our goal here is to assess your open-source contribution skills, communication skills etc. rather than actually delivering the fix.

Once you have completed your contribution and you would like to apply for a position at Datopian, please, send us an email with details to jobs@datopian.com.
