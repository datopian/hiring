Keeping obstacles and distractions out of the team's path, you will act as the interface between the Scrum team and other people (Product owners, clients  and/or other teams)** you will also get to lead project teams delivering for topcaliber clients, with a lot of autonomy to fulfill your role in the way you see best.
 
### Overview
Scrum Leads (Scrum Masters) at Datopian work with Product Owners and delivery teams to ensure project goals are well socialised, sprint planning is well organised, and client needs are being met and exceeded. At Datopian, Scrum leads also take on various administrative tasks as part of our organisational structure for agile project delivery.  

### Key Responsibilities
- Ensuring that goals, scope, and domain of a given project are understood by the delivery team and Product Owner

- Administrative activities supporting project delivery, reporting to the organization’s Delivery Manager
 
### Communication Skills
- Excellent written and spoken English
 
### Required experience
- We’re looking for a candidate with a minimum of 2 years as a scrum master in a start-up / agile environment 
- Someone who has run projects with an agile mindset and NOT someone who works at a IT factory that runs scrum but it’s actually scrum ceremonies with a waterfall mindset. 
- It is preferred but not necessary that the candidate has experience in a professional services company though a scrum master who has worked for a product start-up that is willing to be client facing is also encouraged to apply
 
 
We operate virtually, so you will have the freedom to work from wherever you want (meeting scheduling permitting).
 
Finally, we offer an intentional work environment that will support you to develop personally and professionally and provide an opportunity to reflect on what really matters to you.

### About the engagement
**Start date**: As soon as feasible  
Rate: Commensurate with ability and experience
Location: Datopian is a remote-first workplace; experience in remote working is desirable (but not essential). We are currently looking for people in European  / East Coast US time zone (we’re happy for people to work elsewhere provided they are available for meetings during European / East Coast usual working hours).
