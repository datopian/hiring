## Visual Content Marketing Specialist (Part-time, Remote)

We’re looking for a Visual Content Marketing Specialist who can turn complex ideas about data, technology, and open source into clear, beautiful, and engaging visual stories.
You’ll work across formats — from social posts and carousels to short motion presentations — combining sharp copy with compelling design to help Datopian communicate its work to governments, institutions, and enterprises around the world.

### Key Responsibilities

- Repurpose long-form content (blog posts, articles, thought pieces) into short, visually engaging assets for social media (LinkedIn, X, Bluesky, Reddit, etc.).
- Create carousels, infographics, short copy posts, and other visual formats that communicate complex topics simply and impactfully.
- Design light motion graphics or short videos (e.g., animated carousels, motion presentations, or product promos) to illustrate key ideas from articles, case studies, or product features.
- Write and edit copy for social media, landing pages, and newsletters aligned with Datopian’s tone and positioning.
- Prepare and publish posts on Datopian’s social channels (LinkedIn, X, Bluesky etc.) as part of the content workflow.
- Collaborate with the marketing lead and designers to maintain a consistent brand voice and aesthetic.
- Stay on top of trends in B2G/B2B marketing, open-source communication, and data technology.


### Requirements

- Excellent English writing skills — able to communicate complex technical or policy topics clearly and engagingly.
- Strong sense of visual storytelling (experience with Canva, Figma, or similar tools).
- Proficiency with AI tools for content creation and visualization — we value speed, quality, and effective prompt engineering, not generic AI output.
- Proven experience creating visual content for social media (posts, carousels, infographics, or short videos).
- Familiarity with video or motion design tools (e.g., Canva video, CapCut, etc) — enough to produce simple animations or motion visuals (no advanced production needed).
- Ability to understand and summarize long-form technical content.
- A portfolio of previous work (social posts, carousels, infographics, or similar).
- Bonus: Familiarity with data, open source, civic tech, or digital government.


## About the engagement

* **Start date**: As soon as feasible.
* **Rate**: Competitive and commensurate with responsibilities and abilities.
* **Location**: Datopian is a remote-first workplace; experience in remote working is desirable (but not essential). We are currently looking for people in the European /East Coast US time zone (we’re happy for people to work elsewhere provided they are available for meetings during European / East Coast usual working hours).

## How to apply

**Goal:**
We want to see how you turn complex ideas into engaging marketing materials.

**Task:**
Choose one of the following Datopian case studies: https://www.datopian.com/showcase/case-studies

**Create one of the following:**

**Option A:**

* A LinkedIn carousel (5–8 slides) summarizing the key ideas for a non-technical audience (governments, institutions, data managers).
* A LinkedIn caption (max 200 words) to accompany the carousel.

**Option B:**

* A 10–15 second motion presentation or animated summary of the chosen case study. Focus on clarity, pacing, and message — not advanced effects.

**Format:**
Use Canva, Figma, or any AI-powered design tools. Export your work as a PDF or share a view link, plus a short explanation of your approach (max 5 sentences).

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Clarity and accuracy — you may use AI tools (including ChatGPT) for drafting or ideation, but avoid “AI-sounding” text or buzzwords.
- Prompt engineering skill — ability to get high-quality visual and textual results from AI tools efficiently.
- Visual storytelling — modern, clean, and data-aware design.
- Tone and audience fit — professional yet human and engaging.
- Creativity — originality in summarizing and visualizing technical topics.
