# JavaScript Engineer

Passionate about data? If you want to be part of building the next generation of open source tooling for open data management systems, we’d love to hear from you!
 
A little about us… 
- We’re mission-driven 
- Open-source
- Have a great culture 
- Datopian has been run using self-organisation principles and we are currently experimenting with Holacracy
- Love the freedom that remote / flexible working gives us
- We’re inspired to work on interesting projects (key clients include large public institutions, NGOs and enterprises)

We operate virtually, so you will have the freedom to work from wherever you want (meeting scheduling permitting).

We are looking for a highly-motivated and skilled individual to work with us as **a JavaScript Engineer**. Datopian implements a range of data management solutions for government and the enterprise using open-source technologies, including many that our team creates and maintains in-house.

Engineers at Datopian work as part of a delivery team under technical supervision of a Senior Developer. They communicate about their work with technical and non-technical stakeholders on their team, and therefore need to be proficient in spoken and written English. Our Developers scope and define work with our Senior Developers – depending on level of experience – and are responsible for implementation of a range of data management solutions.

Most of the work we do at Datopian is in Python and JS, and some experience implementing web applications in Python or Node.js is required. As we do a lot of work with data, experience with data wrangling, data engineering, and/or data science is desirable, as is some familiarity with SQL or other database technologies. We also do frontend development with modern JavaScript, and any experience with JavaScript, HTML, or CSS is an advantage.

## Expectations

- Experience: junior to mid level JavaScript engineer.
- Communication and soft skills: needs to be proficient in written and spoken English, confident during presentations and interactions.
- Must know:
  - Git - we use git for everything we do from coding to content writing so you need to use Git via command line and commit your work to GitHub and/or GitLab on a daily basis.
  - JavaScript - pure JS is great but we also use a lot of Next.js nowadays. You can have a look at our frontend framework here - https://github.com/datopian/datahub and also our MarkdownDB library here https://github.com/datopian/markdowndb
- Bonus if you know any of these:
  - CSS - in particular TailwindCSS would be amazing. It's also beneficial if you're familiar with components libraries such as:
    - https://heroicons.com/
    - https://ui.shadcn.com/
    - https://tailwindui.com/
    - others.
  - Design and prototyping skills - we would require you to work with Figma where our designer creates mockups.
  - Any backend skills are always great, e.g., we use Python.
  - Familiarity with containerization using Docker.

## About the engagement

**Start date:** As soon as feasible.

**Rate:** Commensurate with ability and experience.

**Location:** Datopian is a remote-first workplace; experience in remote working is desirable (but not essential). We are currently looking for people in European  / East Coast US time zone (we’re happy for people to work elsewhere provided they are available for meetings during European / East Coast usual working hours).

## How to apply

Below we have a discussion where we need developers to test our framework:

datopian/portaljs#820

It would be great if you could:

- Prepare a dataset of your choice. E.g., it should be something meaningful and interesting to you and your audience. If you want, you can have more than 1 dataset.
- Based on our framework, build a minimal data portal that has catalog page with available datasets and a dataset page where you can showcase the dataset you have prepared.
- Make sure you have table preview and some simple visualization to display insight.
- Deploy your work somewhere, eg, can be Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify etc. Totally up to you!
- Once ready, go to https://loom.com/ and record a quick loom about what you have done.

Once you have completed your contribution and you would like to apply for a position at Datopian, please, send us an email to jobs@datopian.com that contains the following:

- A link to Git repository that contains the assignment.
- A link to your deployment.
- A link to your loom video.
