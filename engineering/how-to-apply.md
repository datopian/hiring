# Open source contribution from Datopian candidates

Hey there!

If you are reading this page, you might be interested in a tech position at the Datopian team. This document describes how one can make an open-source contribution so that Datopian team members can evaluate one's technical expertise and performance. Below we have a discussion where we need developers to test our framework. It would be great if you could prepare a dataset of your choice and create a dataset page or portal using our framework:
