# Data Engineer with Python skills

Passionate about data? If you want to be part of building the next generation of open source tooling for open data management systems, we’d love to hear from you!
 
A little about us… 
- We’re mission-driven 
- Open-source
- Have a great culture 
- Datopian is run using self-organisation principles and Holacracy
- Love the freedom that remote / flexible working gives us
- We’re inspired to work on interesting projects (key clients include large public institutions, NGOs and enterprises)

We operate virtually, so you will have the freedom to work from wherever you want (meeting scheduling permitting).

## About this role

We are looking for a highly-motivated and skilled individual to join us as a **Data Engineer** to work with Python programming language for data processing, wrangling, cleaning and analysis. We also have open-source software written in Python using Flask where your skills will be required.

## Expectations

- Experience: junior to mid level.
- Communication and soft skills: needs to be proficient in written and spoken English, confident during presentations and interactions.
- Must know:
  - Git - we use git for everything we do from coding to content writing so you need to use Git via command line and commit your work to GitHub on daily basis.
  - Python - our main software is written in Python (learn more about it [here](https://github.com/ckan/ckan)) and you need to be able to maintain the code, develop extensions and new features etc. In particular, you would need to know Flask framework and Jinja2 templating engine.
  - Docker - as we ship our software in Docker containers, you need to work with Docker on a daily basis.
- Good to have:
  - Kubernetes - we deploy everywhere (GCP, AWS, Azure or on-prem) using Kubernetes.
  - Terraform - our standard tool for infrastructure-as-a-code approach.
  - Cloud - preference is GCP but experience with AWS/Azure is a great value for us.
- Bonus if you know:
  - JavaScript - pure JS is great but we also use a lot of Next.js nowadays.
  - CSS - in particular TailwindCSS and/or Bootstrap would be amazing.

## About the engagement

**Start date:** As soon as feasible.

**Rate:** Commensurate with ability and experience.

**Location:** Datopian is a remote-first workplace; experience in remote working is desirable (but not essential). We are currently looking for people in European  / East Coast US time zone (we’re happy for people to work elsewhere provided they are available for meetings during European / East Coast usual working hours).

## How to apply

To assess your skills, we require you to take one of the issues in our board where we curate core and open datasets:

https://github.com/orgs/datasets/projects/1

You would need to look at "Ready to go" pipeline and find an issue that sounds good for you. Before you get started please make sure you ping @anuveyatsu in the issue thread so that we can assign the issue to you and avoid duplicate work from other candidates. Please, note that you may take issues from other pipelines (e.g., Evaluating or Preparing and Packaging), especially, if you see that it was leftover by somebody (e.g., no progress/updates for last >2 months).

Once you have completed your contribution and you would like to apply for a position at Datopian, please, send us an email with details to jobs@datopian.com with any relevant information (CV, link to your project etc).
