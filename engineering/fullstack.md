**Passionate about data?** If you want to be part of building the next generation of open-source tooling for open data management systems, we’d love to hear from you.

**A little about us…**

* We’re mission-driven  
* Open-source  
* Have a great culture  
* Datopian has been run using self-organisation principles and we are currently experimenting with Holacracy  
* Love the freedom that remote/flexible working gives us  
* We’re inspired to work on interesting projects (key clients include large public institutions, NGOs, and enterprises)

We are looking for a highly motivated and experienced individual to work with us as a Full-Stack Engineer for a diverse, and rapidly developing enterprise.  
We operate virtually, so you will have the freedom to work from wherever you want (meeting scheduling permitting).  
Finally, we offer an intentional work environment that will support you to develop personally and professionally and provide an opportunity to reflect on what matters to you.

**About the role**  
We are looking for a Full-Stack Engineer to join our growing Client Delivery team. Datopian implements a range of data management solutions for governments and enterprises using open-source technologies, including many that our team creates and maintains in-house.  
Engineers at Datopian work as part of a delivery team under the technical supervision of a Senior Developer. They communicate about their work with technical and non-technical stakeholders on their team and therefore need to be proficient in spoken and written English. Our Developers scope and define work with our Senior Developers \- depending on the level of experience \- and are responsible for the implementation of a range of data management solutions.  
Most of the work we do at Datopian is in Python and JS, and some experience implementing web applications in Python or Node.js is required. As we do a lot of work with data, experience with data wrangling, data engineering, and/or data science is desirable, as is some familiarity with SQL or other database technologies. We also do frontend development with modern JavaScript, and any experience with HTML, or CSS is an advantage.

**Requirements**

* Level: Junior to medium-level software engineer  
* Must Know  
  * Git – We rely on Git for all aspects of our work, from software development to content creation. You should be comfortable using Git via the command line, and it's essential to commit your work to GitHub daily to ensure smooth collaboration.  
  * Python – Our core software is built in Python. You’ll be expected to maintain existing codebases, develop new features, and create extensions. Proficiency in the Flask framework and Jinja2 templating engine is required. We're currently transitioning from Jinja2 to an HTMX-based approach, so experience with either technology is valuable.  
  * Docker – Our software is distributed in Docker containers, so daily interaction with Docker is part of the role. You should be familiar with containerization best practices and workflows.  
  * JavaScript – We primarily use React for our frontend development. While a strong foundation in pure JavaScript is beneficial, familiarity with Next.js is highly desirable as it's increasingly part of our stack.  
  * AI Knowledge – Proficiency in leveraging AI tools and platforms, including hands-on experience with common AI applications and APIs from providers like OpenAI, Claude, and DeepSeek. Ability to integrate AI solutions into workflows and develop AI-powered features is highly valued.  
* Must have social skills  
  * English Proficiency – Strong written and verbal communication skills in English are essential for effective collaboration and client interactions.  
  * Presentation Skills – Ability and willingness to conduct engaging demo sessions, including screen sharing and walkthroughs of features or solutions.  
  * Client Interaction – Confidence in presenting to clients and stakeholders, with the ability to clearly articulate ideas and respond to questions in real-time.  
  * Proactive Communication – Consistently provide regular status updates, check-ins, and progress reports to ensure alignment with team members and clients.  
* Good to know  
  * Design Sense – A good eye for design is always appreciated and encouraged, as it contributes to creating more intuitive and visually appealing solutions.

**Other requirements**

* Problem identification & analysis skills.  
* Strong working etiquette.  
* Documenting & knowledge-archiving skills.
